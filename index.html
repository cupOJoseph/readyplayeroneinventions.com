                <i>Ready Player One</i></a> is a great book about a future where people live in a virtual world to escape the problems with their reality.  See the future inventions that are referenced in the book. Many of them are a reality and have already been made!

        <p> Oculus Rift is now only $399 and the new ones are very light weight.  We're pretty much there with this tech.</p>

            <p>Remember when Wade went through the first gate and had to play through the movie War Games? While there are plenty of video games based on movies, we don't have any "flicksyncs" yet.  We're sure it's only a matter of time.</p>

              <p>All the Gunters love playing old video games, and it's even a rite of passage to code your own.  You too can play old games, but you're going to need some kind of emulator. Raspberry Pis are great for that.</p>

                <img src="https://i.imgur.com/jPPbPDU.jpg" alt="vr gluvs">
                <p>While inventions like leap motion do a great job at tracking hands, there's still room for innovation in haptic feedback.  OASIS users feel like they are really touching things their characters touch.VRgluv is a new product claiming to have figured out gloves, but sadly we haven't invented any simple haptic clothing yet.</p>

                  <p>The first episode of school house rock came out in 1973.  Do you know how a bill becomes a law?</p>

                <p>Aech and Wade have a great little club house where they can remotely sign in to privately chat with each other.  There are lots of multiplayer games and even some cool chat room applications out there for VR.  The most popular right now is VR Chat.</p>

              <img src="https://i.imgur.com/HdUZTCa.jpg" alt="">
              <p>Wade got a great box by his door in his apartment so he wouldn't have to interact with delivery people at all and could securely get deliveries.  We may not be as dependent as Wade, but Amazon package theft is certainy a concern for many. Here's a special box to lock your packages in that was recently funded on kickstarter. </p>

            <p>Dungeons and Dragons is real, more popular then ever, and has nothing to do with satanic rituals.</p>
